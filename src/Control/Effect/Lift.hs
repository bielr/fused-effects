{- | Provides a mechanism to kick off the evaluation of an effect stack that takes place in a monadic context.

'Lift' effects are always the last effect in a given effect stack. These stacks are invoked with 'Control.Carrier.Lift.runM' or 'Control.Algebra.run'.

Predefined carriers:

* "Control.Carrier.Lift"
* 'IO'
* 'Data.Functor.Identity.Identity'

-- | Given a @Lift n@ constraint in a signature carried by @m@, 'sendM'
-- promotes arbitrary actions of type @n a@ to @m a@. It is spiritually
-- similar to @lift@ from the @MonadTrans@ typeclass.

{-# INLINE sendM #-}

-- | A type-restricted variant of 'sendM' for 'IO' actions.
--
-- This is particularly useful when you have a @'Has' ('Lift' 'IO') m@ constraint for the use of 'liftWith', and want to run an action abstracted over 'Control.Monad.IO.Class.MonadIO'. 'IO' has a 'Control.Monad.IO.Class.MonadIO' instance, and 'sendIO'’s type restricts the action’s type to 'IO' without further type annotations.

-- | Run actions in an outer context.
--
-- This can be used to provide interoperation with @base@ functionality like @"Control.Exception".'Control.Exception.catch'@:
--
-- @
-- 'liftWith' $ \\ hdl ctx -> 'Control.Exception.catch' (hdl (m <$ ctx)) (hdl . (<$ ctx) . h)
-- @
--
-- The higher-order function takes both an initial context, and a handler phrased as a distributive law (as described in the documentation for 'Handler'). This handler takes actions lifted into a context functor, which can be either the initial context, or the derived context produced by handling a previous action.
--
-- As with @MonadBaseControl@, care must be taken when lifting functions like @"Control.Exception".'Control.Exception.finally'@ which don’t use the return value of one of their actions, as this can lead to dropped effects.
